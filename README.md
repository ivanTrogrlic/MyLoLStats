# MyLoLStats

Android application which users can use to enter their game statistics (Champion played, win/loss, kills, deaths and assists)
from the League of Legends game. Those statistics are saved in SQLite database, and are used to display animated statistics to 
the user, whether they want to see specific champion statistics, or the champion with the best win rate or KDA (Kills-deaths-assists ratio).
Also, user can see every game they played in a table, where they can delete or update desired games. 

The app is built with fragments, one fragment is shown when device is in the portrait mode, and two are shown when its in the 
landscape mode.
